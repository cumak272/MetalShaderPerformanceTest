# MetalShaderPerformanceTest

This project was built to test and showcase the performance of various Metal shaders on Apple hardware. 

## Features
- **Extensive Shader Collection**: Over 28 shaders running natively via Metal compute kernels.
- **External Display Support**: Project the visualizers to external screens perfectly.
- **Menu Screen**: Easy visualizer selection with fluid marquee scrolling text.

## Credits
All shaders included in this project were manually converted from Shadertoy to Metal. All original rights, designs, and mathematics belong to their respective Shadertoy creators. I am utilizing these solely for performance testing and educational evaluation of Metal compute APIs.
